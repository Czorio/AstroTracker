# Astrotracker

This repository contains the project files for the Astrotracker project.
We're aiming to design a reasonably simple device that allows users to take good shots of the stars at night, without any motion blurring.

## License

The content in the `doc` directory is licensed under the CC4.0-by-sa-nc license.
This directory is mostly used as a general overview of the concepts explored during the development of the project, and the solutions we find for the inevitable problems along the way.
We'd like to keep that information freely accessible with the chosen license.
Any images that are credited with someone elses name should not be considered to be under this license unless explicitly stated.

Any CAD files are licensed under the CERN OHL-W v2.0 or later license.
The way we understand it, this means that if you decided to use (parts of) the designs in your own project, these elements have to be shared with the same license.
For example: we design a doohickey that fenagles the whotsit.
If you incorporate our doohickey design, but don't include our whotsit, you only have to make the design files for the doohickey available.
If you also make changes to the doohickey design files, you must give information about what you changed, and when you changed it, and make them available under the same CERN OHL-W v2.0 or later license.
The recommended approach to sharing the changes is to include these in a `changes.txt` file.
Note that this license only applies to the design _files_, and not a physical object based on them.
The physical object it yours to use, sell, paint, throw in the ocean (please don't), and anything else you can think of.

Firmware, or other code is licensed under the MIT license.
While this license does not force you to share your changes, we'd like to see your improvements!

Should any part of the text above conflict with any part of the licenses described, the license itself should be considered the correct interpretation.
